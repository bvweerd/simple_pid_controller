## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The controller is configured through the UI using the Config Flow {% term config_flow %}.

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration** and choose **Simple PID Controller**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: e.g., "Heater Controller"
   - **Sensor Entity**: e.g., `sensor.living_room_temperature`
4. Submit and finish setup

**Default Range:**  
The controller‚Äôs setpoint range defaults to **0.0 ‚Äì 100.0**. To customize this range, select the integration in **Settings > Devices & Services**, click **Options**, adjust **Range Min** and **Range Max**, and save.

## üéØ PID Tuning Guide

A PID controller continuously corrects the difference between a **setpoint** and **measured value** using:

- **P (Proportional)**: reacts to present error
- **I (Integral)**: compensates for past error
- **D (Derivative)**: predicts future error trends

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Manual (Trial & Error)</strong></summary>

1. Set `Ki` and `Kd` to 0
2. Start with small `Kp` (e.g., 1.0)
3. Increase `Kp` until oscillations appear
4. Halve that `Kp` value
5. Increase `Ki` to reduce steady-state error
6. Add `Kd` to smooth out oscillations

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Ziegler‚ÄìNichols Method</strong></summary>

1. Set `Ki = 0`, `Kd = 0`, increase `Kp` until sustained oscillations
2. Measure:
   - **Ku** = critical gain
   - **Pu** = oscillation period
3. Apply:
   - `Kp = 0.6 √ó Ku`
   - `Ki = 1.2 √ó Ku / Pu`
   - `Kd = 0.075 √ó Ku √ó Pu`

## PID Calculation Frequency and Sample Time

This integration recalculates the PID output at a fixed, user-configurable interval to ensure timely and consistent control updates. Internally, both the PID loop and Home Assistant‚Äôs data coordinator use the same **Sample Time**, but they each maintain their own timer, so slight differences can occur.

- **Sample Time**  
  The minimum number of seconds between successive PID computations. For example, if you set `sample_time: 5`, both the PID controller and the update coordinator are scheduled to fire every 5 seconds.

### How it works in practice

1. **Initialization**  
   - On startup (or when options change), we set up a single `sample_time` value (in seconds).  
   - We register a periodic callback with Home Assistant‚Äôs scheduler (`async_track_time_interval` or `DataUpdateCoordinator`) using that same `sample_time`.  
   - We also configure the PID algorithm‚Äôs internal timer to the same `sample_time`.

2. **Coordinator Tick**  
   - Every `sample_time` seconds, Home Assistant‚Äôs scheduler invokes our update method.  
   - We immediately read the current process variable (e.g. temperature sensor) and pass it to the PID logic.

3. **PID Logic & Output**  
   - The PID algorithm checks whether at least `sample_time` seconds have elapsed since its own last computation.  
   - If so, it calculates the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative terms and writes the result to your target entity (e.g. a heater or set-point).  
   - If not (because the PID‚Äôs internal timer hasn‚Äôt quite reached the next tick), it skips the computation until its own timer allows it.

4. **Timer Drift & Overlap**  
   - Both the coordinator and the PID controller schedule their next run relative to when the current one started. Under heavy load, one callback may run a few milliseconds later than expected.  
   - Because each timer is independent, occasional ‚Äúdouble-ticks‚Äù or small gaps can occur:  
     - If the scheduler drifts early but the PID timer hasn‚Äôt yet reached `sample_time`, no computation runs.  
     - If the PID timer elapses first and the scheduler callback is slightly late, the update happens immediately when the scheduler finally fires.  
   - Over time, these small variances average out, preserving an approximately consistent interval.

5. **Adjusting Sample Time**  
   - Changing `sample_time` in your integration options takes effect at the end of the current interval‚Äîno Home Assistant restart is required.  
   - On the next tick, both the coordinator and the PID logic will use the new interval.

By using a single **Sample Time** for both scheduling and calculation‚Äîand understanding that each component tracks its own clock‚Äîyou get predictable, evenly-spaced control updates while allowing Home Assistant‚Äôs event loop to manage timing drifts gracefully.```
